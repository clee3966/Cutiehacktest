# Coin Counter 
Coin counter uses computer vision to identify coins regardless of size, and counting the coins. 

# Description 
This project was our first experience in machine learning. Machine learing is a career path we are facinated in. We used computer vision to determine wether an object was a coin or not. By using different methods like grayscale, blurring, edge detection, and dialtion the computer is able to detect coins. We made a website where the user could input their own image of coins to test the computers ability to detect coins.

# Usecase
Although our algorithim is very simple, companies might be able to use this image detection software to auomatedly recognize money.
